        <p class="hqintro">After unknowingly entering Croc’s Lair in the events of Arkham Asylum (after trying to escape from Batman), he was brutally maimed by Killer Croc and left to die. Despite suffering from a broken leg and mauled face he managed to escape from the sewers and made it back to Gotham unseen. His face was severely disfigured, missing teeth, chunks of his nose and going blind in his right eye. He decided to blame Batman for his pain and planned for years to ultimately unmask  and break him.
          Although presumed dead during the happenings of Arkham City, Scarecrow continued his work in secret, perfecting his toxin. He used agents during Protocol 10 to gather information while he remained in hiding. A secret shipment of insects with neuro-toxins were found in The Falcone shipping yard belonging to Scarecrow. He later sent hidden radio frequencies to Batman’s cryptographic sequencer, once translated the numeric codes read: “I will return”, “You will pay for what you have done to me”, and “Fear will tear Gotham to shreds”.

After Batman evacuated the two surviving Ace Chemicals workers from the site, he confronted Scarecrow in the Central Mixing Chamber. Maintaining his composure, Crane knelt down with both of his hands behind his head, and showed no resistance. However, Batman smashed his head against the control panel, and demanded to know how the Fear Toxin could be stopped. Confident, Crane explained that it's impossible to stop, and that the building would soon explode and release his Fear Toxin. Scarecrow then warned the Dark Knight to release him, claiming that Barbara Gordon would be killed if he didn't comply. Batman distracted himself to contact the Clock Tower, at which point Oracle was abducted. Scarecrow escaped, and locked Batman in; departing, he taunted Batman by telling him that nothing hurts more than the death of someone closest to you.</br>

      <p class="hqintro">
      </br> After Ace Chemicals, Crane returned to the Militia's HQ, where he would keep tabs on Batman's progress with fighting Gotham's Most Wanted. Scarecrow continued taunting Batman via the monitors, insisting that everything that happened to Batman's allies was the Dark Knight's own fault, and that his efforts over the years were pointless. At one point, he wondered if Batman had thought he was dead before this Halloween night, due to his near-death experience back at the Asylum. Noting that Batman used fear to control thugs, Scarecrow declared that he has usurped the "the throne" the Dark Knight ruled from; Scarecrow saw himself as "the sovereign" now.</br>
      </p>
    <p class="hqintro"></br>Needing better resources for his research, Crane entered a partnership with Simon Stagg. After months of extensive research, Crane ended up creating a strain of Fear Toxin that could be absorbed through the skin, effectively making gas masks useless; though hazmat suits would be effective. Another project of theirs was the Cloudburst, a device that could spread the Fear Toxin as a giant cloud, while amplifying its potency; the Nimbus Cell powering it would effectively double as an EMP, disabling any electronics not powered by the cell. Secretly, Stagg sought to reverse-engineer the Fear Toxin to cure depression; he was annoyed with Crane's obsession with revenge against Batman, willing to take the formula by force if needed.

            <p class="hqintro">
              Scarecrow revealed he was broadcasting live across the city, seeking to make Gordon unmask Batman so that Gotham could see their beloved hero's face as he succumbed to the Fear Toxin. Initially, Gordon protested, so Scarecrow shot Robin in the chest. Robin lived due to his suit's armor, but Scarecrow threatened to shoot him in the head if Gordon didn't cooperate. Batman told Gordon it was the only way and the Commissioner reluctantly unmasked him; upon Batman's unmasking, the televisions showing the broadcast and its reaction were full of shock as the Dark Knight was revealed to be Bruce Wayne.</br>
            </br> Scarecrow was surprised to see that his old foe was a supposed billionaire playboy. He then explained he wouldn't kill Bruce, but instead "set him free" to watch as Gotham fall apart at the shock of learning Batman's true identity, and to watch thugs attack his allies to get revenge for all that Batman has done to them. Scarecrow then proceeded to inject Bruce with his fear toxin, hoping to expose him as a fraud. He then watched as Batman began writhing in agony as the toxin began taking hold on his mind. </br>Moments later, he gloated that soon Bruce's life would be over. To his shock, Crane heard Batman say it was a good thing. Baffled, Scarecrow asked if Batman could understand it's over. Batman told him to get ready for the encore, laughing madly. Wondering "why aren't you scared?", Crane injected Batman with another dose of the Fear Toxin. Unbeknownst to Scarecrow, he was actually speaking to the Joker, who had managed to gain control of Batman's body. However, this extra dose of the toxin was just was what Batman needed to show Joker his own fear of being forgotten, and eradicate his prescence in his mind.
            </p>
            <p class="hqintro">
            </br>To Scarecrow's shock, Batman flatly told him he wasn't scared. Annoyed, Crane gave him another dose of the Fear Toxin. However, Batman continued to fight off the effects. Declaring that life is meaningless without fear, Scarecrow pulled out his gun, pointing it as Batman's head. However, it was shot out of his hand by the Red Hood, who sided with Batman once more. Scarecrow ready another injection, hoping to kill Batman with a stabbing to the head. However, Red Hood's next shot freed Batman's arms.

            <p class="hqintro">
            </br>Grabbed by the Dark Knight, Scarecrow was given a dose of his own medicine, despite his protests. Feeling the effects of the toxin, Scarecrow tried fighting off the visions it gave him. However, upon hearing Batman ask if he was scared, Crane let go of all restraint, yelling in fear; he saw Batman as a demonic bat figure, commanding a swarm of bats. Trying to flee, Crane was knocked out by Gordon.
