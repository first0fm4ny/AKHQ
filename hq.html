         <p class="hqintro">
           Originally the second Robin, Jason Todd displayed a great deal of aptitude to his role under the guidance of Batman - hinting towards his lack of restraint and willingness to kill in some situations. Before the incidents of Arkham Asylum,  it was implied that the Joker blew up a school house of children and he decided that the Joker needed to die; knowing that Batman would never cross that line. Jason turned off his com link and tracer and tracked Joker to an abandoned area of Arkham Asylum. He was soon overwhelmed and beaten to unconsciousness. Now held captive by Joker he was relentlessly tortured both physically and psychologically for over a year. Within that time he was severely beaten with a crowbar, branded with a hot iron rod and was shown a photograph of Batman’s new Robin – Tim Drake. Batman’s search for Jason was unsuccessful and presumed he was dead. Joker recorded an interview with Jason showing Batman that he finally broke him. He was then shot in the chest when he was about to reveal Batman’s identity and left to rot.
   Jason survived because of his body armor and soon regained consciousness. After feeling abandoned by Batman and replaced by another Robin he eventually snapped and decided that Batman had to die for this betrayal.

          <p class="hqintro">
            The Arkham Knight eventually found Scarecrow, killing his men as a demonstration of his skills, and advised him on how to take revenge on the Bat. At this time he already had an army trained in Batman’s techniques and gave Scarecrow the plan to drive the citizens out of Gotham in order to bring the full force of his army unhindered into the city. He tested Batman to the limit with the use of his unmanned drones, knowing he would hold back otherwise. All of the crime lords in Gotham were united under the common goal of breaking the Bat. The identity of Oracle (Barbara Gordon) was revealed to Scarecrow and was later kidnapped by The Knight as leverage. The super soldier Deathstroke was also hired as it was known that he and Batman had a long rivalry. He was also a militia consultant and backup Commander as a contingent.</p>

          The Arkham Knight possesses immense skills in military grade tactics, strategies and protocols. He has the disciplined mind of a true military commander with the strategic mind of Deathstroke. His tactical skills are equal to that of
          Batman, and has outsmarted him on multiple occasions.
          He has learnt how to lead an entire army with extreme charisma, intimidating techniques and the power of suggestion. He is also skilled enough to help his army adapt to the Batman's tactics and fighting styles.</p>
          <p class="hqintro">
          </br> Master of Stealth, Espionage and Escape Arts -- The Knight could freely move about Gotham while remaining undetected by the highly vigilant Batman and has even managed to spy on the latter without him noticing. He was able to personally ambush the Batman a feat that not even the most intelligent of Gotham City's criminals could accomplish. </p>
          <p class="hqintro" >
            <br />The Arkham Knight donned a militaristic version of the Batsuit that mocked Batman's appearance. The inside of his helmet and the tactical visor that covered it gave him a heads up display of his units throughout Gotham and the ears relayed his commands to his troops. The visor also appeared to mask his voice as his main means of concealing his identity. By using the Arkham symbol on his chest plate, he inflicted psychological warfare on Batman, which reminded him of the past Arkham events. The chest plate also acted as a countermeasure to the Batclaw. After he revealed his identity as Jason Todd before his final battle with Batman, he discarded his visor, and revealed a featureless, bowl-shaped helmet that glowed red. He continued to use it following his transition to the Red Hood.<br />

            <br />The Knight had finally revealed his true identity while Batman attempted to rescue Commissioner Gordon in the Militia HQ. After raising his helmet, the “J” brand left on him from Joker’s torture was still visible and Jason demanded to know how long he actually searched for him before giving up and replacing him. He also revealed that the Joker had convinced him to hate Batman for abandoning him. After a long fight Batman managed to get through to him and was willing to help him after apologizing. Jason deserted his role as the Arkham Knight and became the vigilante known as Red Hood, eventually saving Batman in the end when he was captured and unmasked by Scarecrow

           </br> The Red Hood was the alias of a particularly infamous criminal active during Batman's early years as the Caped Crusader. As indicated by the name, the criminal wore a red bowl-shaped helmet as a means of covering his identity, although it is strongly implied that the person wearing the disguise was always different. The Red Hood is most notorious as being the former identity of The Joker prior to his encounter with Batman.

     Since Jason Todd changed the Arkham Knight persona, he was able to lay his long-rooted vengeance against Batman to rest, and began to heal the damage that Joker inflicted on him at Arkham Asylum. It was during this recovery that the Red Hood was born, and is implied to have become the permanent holder of the identity. However, while he was once again aligned with his former mentor in wanting to rid Gotham City of its criminal contingent, Todd's willingness to take lives will forever keep them at odds.</br>
             Some time following Batman's initiation of the Knightfall Protocol, Jason restarted his career as a vigilante. Seeking to eliminate crime lord Black Mask, he attacked his thugs during an arms deal, then proceeded to eliminate his weapon storage unit's security detail. Interrogating a survivor for his location, Red Hood dueled Black Mask in person at his downtown office, proving victorious. However, instead of granting Sionis mercy, Todd kicked the mob boss out of a window to his death several stories below. Alluding to his personal hatred of the Joker, Red Hood told Sionis to greet the clown for him in hell.</br>

             gunship was personally used to destroy the bridge to ACE Chemicals to buy Scarecrow enough time to create his Fear Toxin.Rumored to be operating somewhere on Founders' Island, he has effectively locked down the city while preventing outside intervention. The countless drones at his disposal feed live data directly to his cowl, allowing him to
             monitor the city in real-time. There is almost no movement the Batman can make without his knowledge.
